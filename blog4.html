    <h1>Cypress vs. Selenium: Which One Should You Choose?</h1>
    <p>Automation testing is essential for modern software development, and two of the most popular tools for web automation testing are Cypress and Selenium. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, making it crucial to choose the right one based on your project requirements.</p>

    <h2>When to Choose Cypress?</h2>
    <p>If your project is heavily focused on modern JavaScript applications (React, Angular, Vue), Cypress is a great choice because of its fast execution and easy setup. It's ideal for UI and component testing but has limited browser support.</p>
    
    <h2>When to Choose Selenium?</h2>
    <p>If you need extensive cross-browser support, integration with multiple programming languages, and full end-to-end testing capabilities, Selenium is the better choice. It's more flexible for large-scale applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Choosing between Cypress and Selenium depends on your project needs. If speed and ease of use are your priorities, go with Cypress. If you need cross-browser testing and greater flexibility, Selenium is the way to go.</p>
